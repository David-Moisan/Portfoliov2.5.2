                                After a career in the French Army as a
                                parachutist, I decided to retrain in the field
                                of web development in 2020. I therefore resumed
                                my studies with the WIS Toulouse school to
                                validate a BTS Web and mobile web development as
                                well as a Digital Project Manager license.
                                Unfortunately, I did not find a work-study
                                program to continue my studies in master's
                                degree in computer engineering.

                                Since I discovered IT development, I have never
                                stopped learning every day, driven by curiosity
                                and a growing passion.
