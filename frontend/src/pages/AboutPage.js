                                After a career in the French army as a
                                paratrooper, I decided to convert to the field
                                of web development in 2020. So I resumed my
                                studies with the WIS school in Toulouse to
                                validate a BTS DWWM as well as a Project Manager
                                License. I started a Master's degree in Computer
                                Engineering in 2022 for a two-year work-study
                                period, after having found a work-study program
                                in the banking sector, I had a proposal for a
                                permanent contract in the field of Insurance,
                                which I immediately accepted. Indeed, living
                                from my passion was my goal since the beginning
                                of my retraining. So I stopped my Master in the
                                course of the first year without validating it.
                                And it's therefore in the field of insurance
                                that I take up arms again, but this time sitting
                                on an office chair in order to manage the EDI
                                flows of a company wich generates millions in
                                turnover. Here I'm finally full stack Web
                                Developer in a technology that I particularity
                                like PHP.

                                Since I discovered IT development, I have never
                                stopped learning every day, driven by curiosity
                                and a growing passion.
