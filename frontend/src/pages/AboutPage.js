                    <p>
                        After a career in the French Army as a parachutist, I
                        decided to retrain in the field of web development in
                        2020. I therefore resumed my studies with the WIS
                        Toulouse school to validate a BTS Web and mobile web
                        development as well as a Digital Project Manager
                        license. Unfortunately, I did not find a work-study
                        program to continue my studies in master's degree in
                        computer engineering.

                    <p>
                        Since I discovered IT development, I have never stopped
                        learning every day, driven by curiosity and a growing
                        passion.
