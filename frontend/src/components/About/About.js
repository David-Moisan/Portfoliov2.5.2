                            After a career in the French Army as a parachutist,
                            I decided to retrain in the field of web development
                            in 2020. I therefore resumed my studies with the WIS
                            Toulouse school to validate a BTS Web and mobile web
                            development as well as a Digital Project Manager
                            license. Unfortunately, I did not find a work-study
                            program to continue my studies in master's degree in
                            computer engineering.

                            Since I discovered IT development, I have never
                            stopped learning every day, driven by curiosity and
                            a growing passion.
